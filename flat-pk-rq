# --- Script Logic ---

# Use sudo apt-get install with the array of packages
# The -y flag automatically answers yes to prompts

# Option 1: Standard installation (apt-get will skip already installed packages by default)
# sudo apt-get -y install "${packages[@]}"

# Option 2: More explicit way to handle already installed packages
# We can leverage apt-get's behavior, it will only install/upgrade if needed.
# The -y flag handles the confirmation.

# Let's use the simpler and standard approach, which is what apt-get does by default.
# apt-get will check for dependencies and only install/upgrade what's necessary.

# Add a confirmation step before running sudo

# The comment "skip already install packages" refers to apt-get's default behavior.

# but this is usually not necessary.
